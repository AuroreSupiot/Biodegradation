# Biodegradation

## Data Source

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation

## Context

The dataset is about the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules. Biodegradation experimental values of 1055 chemicals were collected in 41 columns.

## Objectives

The aim is to predict if a chemicals is biodegradable or not. It is a classification project.

## Process

The steps of this project are  : 
 * Data preprocessing
 * Feature selection for model(s)
 * Use useless features for clustering 
 * Use useful features & cluster for modeling.
